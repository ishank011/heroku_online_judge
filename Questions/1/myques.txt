Yash is a strong believer of justice.

He has two nephews: Abhiroop and Alok.

He went to the market to buy candy bags as gifts for his nephews. He brings two types of bags:
  1. Containing 'a' candies and Abhiroop written on them
  2. Containing 'b' candies and Alok written on them

After coming back, he realizes that he has 'N' bags of type 1 and 'M' bags of type 2.
He can gift a bag to a nephew if only if his name is written on it.

Now, since he is a strong believer of justice he wants that the number of candies received by both his nephews is equal.

Determine if there is a way he can gift his nephews a non-zero number of candy bags such that the above said conditions are satisfied.

Note: It is guaranteed that when he gifts either of his two nephews, he gifts a complete bag of candies.
      Also, he need not gift all candy bags, if required he may have to keep a few with himself.

Input format:

The first line contains two space-separated positive integers 'a' and 'b': the number of candies in the two types of bags.
