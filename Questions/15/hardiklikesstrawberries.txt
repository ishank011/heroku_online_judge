Hardik loves strawberries so much that he carries them around in his pocket. In fact he is so desperate to buy strawberries that he is prepared to sell all his belongings just to get his hands on some fresh strawberries in the market. He has N items. Each of them have a cost Ci and quantity Qi associated with them, which means that selling one piece of that item gets him Ci amount of money and he can sell a maximum of Qi pieces of that item. The total cost of strawberries he wants to buy is K.

Hardik wonders how many ways there are to make exactly K money by selling some of his items. He can choose to sell between 0 to Qi pieces of the ith item. Write a program that helps him do this.

Input Format

The first line of input contains N and K, denoting the number of items and total money to be made respectively. The second line contains N integers [C1,C2...CN] denoting the costs of these items. The third line also contains N integers [Q1,Q2...QN] denoting the respective quantities of these items.

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 100
1 <= K, Ci, Qi <= 1000

Output Format

Output exactly one line containing a single Integer containing the number of ways as stated in the problem statement modulo 10^9+7

Sample Input

3 10
2 3 4
3 4 3

Sample Output

4

Explanation

There are 4 ways to achieve total value of 10

1) Select 1 piece of 1st item and 2 pieces of 3rd item i.e 2*1+3*0+4*2=10
2) Select 2 pieces of 1st item and 2 pieces of 2nd item i.e 2*2+3*2+4*0=10
3) Select 3 pieces of 1st item and 1 piece of 3rd item i.e 2*3+3*0+4*1=10
4) Select 2 pieces of 2nd item and 1 piece of 3rd item i.e 2*0+3*2+4*1=10
